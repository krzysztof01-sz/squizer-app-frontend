        <Heading>Why did I create sQuizer?</Heading>
        <p>
          In my previous project
          <a className="link" href="https://burza-idzie.web.app">
            <i>(Csale)</i>
          </a>{' '}
          I was working with firebase. It turned out to be a really powerful technology but I was a bit disgusted that I didn't
          know how it works. I mean I knew nothing about authentication, security and working with backend. So in order to learn
          it I decided to create a small project which later became more complex. Finally, I've learned a lot of thing doing this
          project so I achieved my basic goal.
        </p>

        <Heading>Am I planning to add new features?</Heading>
        <p>
          Yes, I'm planning to add better authentication because now I still use partially localStorage for handling user
          authentication on the frontend side (backend has cookie-based auth) or totally change it on cookie + session. Also
          comments deleting and random quiz generation. But I don't guarantee that I'll be done in 100% ðŸ˜„.
