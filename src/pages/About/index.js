        <h2 className="header">Why did I create sQuizer?</h2>
        <p>
          In my previous project
          <a className="link" href="https://github.com/krzysztof01-sz/csale-react-olx-clone">
            <i>(Csale)</i>
          </a>{' '}
          I was working with firebase. I turned out to be a really powerful technology but I was a
          bit disgusted that I didn't know how it works. I mean I knew nothing about authentication,
          security and working with backend. So in order to learn it I decided to create a small
          project which later became more complex. Finally, I've learned a lot of thing doing this
          project so I achieved my basic goal.
        </p>

        <h2 className="header">Am I planning to add new features?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes, I'm planning to add better authentication because now I still use partially
          localStorage for handling user authentication on the frontend side (backend has
          cookie-based auth) or totally change it on cookie + session. Also comments deleting and
          random quiz generation. But I don't guarantee that I'll be done in 100% ðŸ˜„.
